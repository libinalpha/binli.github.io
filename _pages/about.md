My work has been published in books edited by prestigious scholars in OM, and also in flagship journals such as Management Science and Naval Research Logistics. I serve as Ad Hoc reviewers for leading journals such as Production and Operations Management, Naval Research Logistics, and IISE Transactions, etc.
